This project demonstrates the knowledge of authors in data science and machine learning.\n",

This repository also contains three Python files, each implementing a different machine learning model: `knn_pumpkinseed.py`, `logistic_regression_pumkinseed.py`, and `neural_network_pumpkinseed.py`. There is also the `pumpkin_seeds.csv`, which contains the data and `Pumpkin_seeds.pdf`, which contains some description of the dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset came from the study `The use of machine learning methods in classification of pumpkin seeds (Cucurbita pepo L.).` by Koklu, M., Sarigil, S., & Ozbek, O. in 2021. In their paper, they used a product shooting box to obtain quality images of the pumpkin seeds. The authors converted the images to a gray tone and then to binary images. To convert the image data into a CSV file, they extracted 12 morphological features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the CSV file has 13 columns/features and 2500 rows. The first 12 columns are from the extracted morphological features, while the last column classifies whether it belongs to the Urgup Sivrisi or Cercevelik species. There are 2500 rows, representing a single seed used in the study. There are 1200 Urgup Sivrisi and 1300 Cercevelik species of pumpkin seeds. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features found in this CSV file are as follows:\n",
    "1. Area – Number of pixels within the borders of a pumpkin seed\n",
    "2. Perimeter – Circumference in pixels of a pumpkin seed\n",
    "3. Major_Axis_Length – Large axis distance of a pumpkin seed\n",
    "4. Minor_Axis_Length – Small axis distance of a pumpkin seed\n",
    "5. Convex_Area – Number of pixels of the smallest convex shell at the region formed by the\n",
    "pumpkin seed.\n",
    "6. Equiv_Diameter – Computed as !4𝑎⁄𝜋, where 𝑎 is the area of the pumpkin seed.\n",
    "7. Eccentricity – Eccentricity of a pumpkin seed\n",
    "8. Solidity – Convex condition of the pumpkin seeds\n",
    "9. Extent – Ratio of a pumpkin seed area to the bounding box pixels\n",
    "10. Roundness – Ovality of pumpkin seeds without considering the distortion of the edges.\n",
    "11. Aspect_Ration – Aspect ratio of the pumpkin seeds\n",
    "12. Compactness – Proportion of the area of the pumpkin seed relative to the area of the circle\n",
    "with the same circumference\n",
    "13. Class – Either Cercevelik or Urgup Sivrisi\n",
