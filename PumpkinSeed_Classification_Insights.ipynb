These graphical representations, with their focus on frequency distributions, highlight key characteristics such as skewness, modality, and the spread of data. For features with distributions skewing left or right, we observe an asymmetrical spread, indicating a higher concentration of data points on one side of the mean. This skewness can be crucial in understanding the natural tendencies of certain features. Features exhibiting a more symmetrical distribution around the zero mark suggest a relatively even spread on both sides of the mean, implying no significant skewness. The presence of multiple peaks in some histograms hints at multimodality, which could be a sign of underlying subgroups within the data. Additionally, the spread and range of the data within these histograms, particularly any data points lying far from the central cluster, might signal outliers or unusual variations."

But they may not have performed any better than kNN because they both rely on a few assumptions about the dataset, such as features being independent, which we saw in the EDA that some features in the dataset do have correlations with one another and the data being normally distributed, which some of the features have slightly skewed distributions.\n",
